Paradox v0.4 Demo Patch Notes


Bug Fixes:
-fixed grapple and box interactions. The grapple should now properly attach to the box, as well as preventing errors when the box falls off a cliff.
-fixed grapple not going exactly where the mouse was
-fixed walljumping not giving you a speed bonus
-fixed a bug where you couldn't apply settings beacause the 'Apply' button was missing.
-fixed a bug where boxes wouldn't freeze/unfreeze properly when changing timelines
-greatly reduced box performance cost
-fixed bug where training menu ui would show during settings screen
-fixed hitstop not working ever lol
-fixed bug where hitboxes would spawn in the origin of the world 

Main Menu
Added exit button (I can't believe it didn't already have one...)
Can now press "*" to turn on debug mode 
Debug mode now draws hitboxes of attacks

Moveable Objects
Boxes no longer lock rotation
Boxes now become paradoxes instead of sharing your timeline
	- For example, if you're in the future, and you grapple a box, it can still collide with things in the past
Boxes now change color when grappled to show they're now paradoxes ( dark purple tint )


General
Timelines no longer pause. Some examples of changes:
	-If you switch timelines after leaving something on top of a switch (i.e., a box) it will still be treated as on
	-Enemies will still run towards the last location they saw you 
Collision may be very buggy

Switches
Switching timelines while on top of a switch now makes it turn off due to the new timeline changes

Settings
Can now cancel after pressing a rebind button by pressing the Escape key
Now prevents certain inputs from being bindable

Levels
Removed "View Timeline" button
	-Other timelines are now consistanly visible, as if you were always holding the "view timeline" button.
	-Increased visiblity of non focused timeline from 15% to 20%
Added Paradoxes (hey its the name of the game)
	-Pieces of the map that exist in both timelines.
	-Interactable at all times
	-Colored very dark purple
Reaching checkpoints now raise the boundary closer to you. No more having to re-do parts.


Training
Removed starting enemy. (it was annoying me)
Added training puzzle (use the walls in the future to get up to it)
	-Rotate box around to make box land on switch
	-Use the switches in the past to move paradoxes arounds  
Removed past switch that rotates random object (was just testing switches)

Emergence (First Level)
Added more content to the level 
Must now pick up grappling hook to use it.
Tweaked platform positions.
Removed view timeline prompt, since button no longer exists.
Elevator now returns back to its starting position at a accelerated pace after reaching the top (whoops)

Paraghoul
New Enemy
-Paradox enemy, exists in both timelines
-Invulnerable to physical attacks, attached to paradoxes
-Must destroy paradox object to defeat them
-	Different linked objects will give them different abilities in the future (like, later, not the timeline)
-Flies around shooting fireballs at the player
-Taking over darkstalkers as the game's default enemy.

Darkstalker( what the main enemy wass called )
Removed from the game.
	- Behaviour is too unpredictable, makes them buggy and annoying to debug 
	- Sprites are very limited, makes it difficult to add things to them.
	- Doesn't really play off the timeline aspect very well, too generic
	- Just not fun to fight	


Player
Can now buffer dodge at any time
Dodge boost is now dependant on your movement input instead of your previous velocity	
	-Before, it would give you a flat boost towards the direction you were already moving. 
Decreased dodge cooldown (0.9 -> 0.8)
Increased ground pound object push (700 units away, 500 units up) -> (1000 units away, 650 units up)
Greatly increased 3rd combo hit camera shake strength (0.5 -> 3.5)
1st hit of ground combo upwards hitbox shifted (I moved it by accident but i don't care enough to find the old version)
Changed hitstop speed from 25% to 5% (you won't know the difference because its been broken this whole time)
Improved hitbox collision by accident (we take those)

Grappling Hook

Comments:
	Seemed a little too fast to control properly, but took too long to use mid jump. Toning it down while adding some other functionalities to it.

Greatly increased grapple speed (600u -> 1050u)
Greatly nerfed grapple damage (10 -> 2) (Will probably remove its ability to do damage, i have to add stuff to enemy ai in order to prvent them getting lamed out by this)
Nerfed grapple horizontal pull speed (6.5 -> 5.5)
Nerfed grapple upwards pull speed (12 -> 10.5)
Added cooldown on grapple release (0 -> 0.1) 
Will now pull moveable objects towards you,can yank objects with boost (was supposed to be in last patch)
Grapple now falls down towards the ground after a short duration (0.55 seconds)
	-Prevents just shooting it straight up to grapple the top of the level and cheese it 
Added new ui pointer to see where you're aiming (glows green when grapple latches object, red on cooldown)
Grapple automatically releases when hitting a boundary
Now aimable with controller (use right axis stick)
Grapple boost now pulls upwards while grounded.
Grapple boost will now overwrite downwards momentum as well as give you 25% more vertical speed if grappling upwards during the first time you boost while in the air. 
	-Grapple boosts after the first one remain unchanged.
