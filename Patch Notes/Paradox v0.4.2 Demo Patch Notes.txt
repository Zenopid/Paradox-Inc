Generic Level
-Unfocused timeline visiblity increased from 20% to 35% (maybe i need better glasses...)

All Entities
Health bar now flashes when entity is damaged.

Player:

-Increased object yank by 30%
	Player pull remains unchanged 

-Dodge boost now can overwrite your speed in the other direction
	In the previous version, if you're moving 1000 units to the right, and you dodged to the left, you would slow down.
	Now, in the same situation, your speed will be overwritten and it'll be as if you dodged to the left from a stand still.
	Great as an airbreak in case you overshot a jump or something

-Dodge now jump cancellable from the air when you're actionable (you can cancel dodge starting frame 20)

-Jumping from a slide adjusted slightly
	For some reason, the slide jump code that I haven't changed in over 3 months decided to stop working
	with my upgrade to a newer version of the engine, so i had to create new code, and i cannot 100% replicate the old one.

-Can now continue sliding mid air (its funny)
-Sliding mid air pauses slide

Paraghoul
-Increased health bar UI size.
	-Health remains unchanged (inherits link object's health)
