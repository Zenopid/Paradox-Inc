Paradox v1.0.0 Patch Notes

Bug Fixes:
Fixed a bug where you couldn't use rebind keys to f or the mouse buttons.
Fixed a bug where the player would automatically start falling during an aerial attack
Fixed a bug where the ghost UI scene would not be in the center of the screen after a level.
Fixed a bug where you couldn't use the controller to move through the UI.
Fixed a bug where you couldn't drift during air attacks
Fixed a bug changing coyote time
Fixed a bug where rolling wasn't proj invlv for real this time 99% sure 
Fixed a bug where air attack 1 froze at the last frame of animation, preventing you from doing anything until you hit the ground
Strike and Projectile hitbox optimizations
Seperated detection and collision so now things can track the player without being able to hit them.

Added a version tracker in the top right of the main menu.

New Game Mode: Time Attack
When you complete a level, you now have the ability to save your playthrough as a ghost.
Race against a ghost to try and obtain a high score.


New Game Mode: Free Play
Play through a level with the grapple and all items (none right now) available.

System
	-Added bgm to main menu, training mode, and Emergence
	-Changed default controls for controller
		- Dodge moved from right action (Sony Circle Button) to top action (Sony Triangle Button)
		- Crouch moved from left stick down to right action (Sony Circle Button)
		- Added debug mode button (L3)

New Garbage Container
	-Extremely heavy object, preventing the grapple from being very effective
	-Paraghouls can attach to it, becoming extra deadly (notes are below)
	-Large health pool
	-Explodes into garbage bags

Added Saving and Loading
	- Was completely broken in the last patch. Kind of broken and didn't save stuff created in the level like boxes and enemies. Now completely overhauled to work properly.
	- Will save the following:
	  User Settings
          Game Info (Checkpoints, player info like position, enemies, etc)
	  Saved ghosts
	Looking into ways to prevent fps drops while loading

Removed restart level button
	-For some reason its really buggy. The functionality only really saves a second or 2 so it's not that serious.


Player 

Camera:
	-Increased camera zoom (1.2x -> 1.5x)
	-Offset camera upwards 0.75 meters and 2.5 meters in the direction that you're facing
	(This used to be in the game, not sure when it disappeared but its back now)
	-Camera now faces the opposite way when wall sliding / wall running (away from the wall, towards where the 	sprite is looking)


Slide:
	-No longer has its own coyote time 


Jump:
	-Added particle effects to normal jumps / super jumps
	-Added sfx to jumps 

Increased invlv timer (0.4 -> 0.8)
	- This is to offset future hitstun / knockback changes
Removed horizontal deceleration from landing after a fall 

Dodge:
	Dodge now cancels if button is not held while actionable
	To stay in dodge, continue holding the button
	Reduced dodge cooldown (0.8 -> 0.45 seconds)
	Reduced dodge boost to compensate for cooldown reduction (0.25 -> 0.2 mps bonus)

Grapple:
	
	Removed grapple damage (2 -> 0)
	Can now stun enemies during certain attacks if you boost pull
	Increased grapple projectile speed (10.5 mps -> 13 mps)
	Decreased time before grapple falls (0.55 sec -> 0.4 sec)

Attacks:
	
	Nerfed drift during air attacks (0.17 mps in air naturally vs 0.1 mps during attacks)

	Added attack buffer (length of 0.1 seconds)
	Decreased ground pound horizontal deceleration (85% -> 25%)
	Increased damage of 3rd attack in grounded combo (20 -> 25 dmg)
	3rd hit startup increased (9 -> 11 frames)
	Increased minimum damage of ground pound (15 -> 25 dmg)

	Can now buffer jumping and dodging out of air attacks
	
	Changed hitbox size of all attacks due to new sprites

	Ground Pound:
		- No longer collides with enemies while falling

Wallslide:

	Wallslide collision size increases with velocity to make it easier to wall bounce from higher speeds	

	Wallbounce window increased (0.2 -> 0.35 seconds)
	Increased height of wall slide jump by 0.75 meters

Wallrun (New):
	
	Run up wall that you are touching, can bounce/jump off walls similarly to wallslide
	One wall run that refreshes on touching the ground
	Speed slowly decays after a brief delay, will eventually transition to a wall slide once enough speed lost
	


Paraghoul

	New type: Garbage Bag Ghoul:
	Glass cannon, since garbage bags are lighter and have less hp then boxes
	Has fire ramming attack that slams into the player
	Grapple pulling a charging ghoul will stun them

	New type: Garbage Container Ghouls
	Miniboss
	Has new ground pound attack that shoots out highly damaging shockwaves
	Can be stunned by attacks after the ground pound to be struck by follow up melee attacks
	Also contains ram attack of garbage bag ghouls

	-Added pathfinding 
	- Striking dazed Paraghouls will also damage link objects 
	-Paraghouls will now try to hover above the player rather than fly into them.
	-Added sfx to fireballs travelling and hitting targets

	Shrunk length but increased height for fireball hitbox 
	Fireball now starts at max speed
	Fireball steers around much faster (2 -> 7)

	

Trooper
	-New enemy type
	-Grounded humanoid attack type that runs around shooting plasma bolts that travel in a straight line
	-Will try to dodge attacks
