		- Crouch moved from left stick down to right action (Sony Circle Button)

New Garbage Container

	-Paraghouls can attach to it, becoming extra deadly (notes are below)
	-Large health pool
	-Explodes into garbage bags

Added Saving and Loading
	- Was completely broken in the last patch. Kinda broken and didn't save stuff created in the level like boxes and enemys. Now completely overhauled to work properly.
	- Will save the following:
	  User Settings
          Game Info (Checkpoints, player info like position, enemies, etc)
	  Saved ghosts
	Looking into ways to prevent fps drops while loading

Removed restart level button
	-For some reason its really buggy. The functionality only really saves a second or 2 so it's not that serious.
