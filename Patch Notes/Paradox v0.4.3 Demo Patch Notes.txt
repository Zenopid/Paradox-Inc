Paradox v0.4.3 Patch Notes

I hate using Pixels Per Second so

100 pixels = 1 meter

MPS = Meters Per Second

Bug Fixes
-Fixed a bug where you could triple jump out of a slide.
-Fixed a bug where you could jump for free out of a dodge.
-Fixed a bug where dodge wasn't projectile invlv.
-Fixed a bug where you could roll in place (maybe i'll add a spotdodge with art update)
-Fixed a bug where changing the speed of the game in Training still effected the game after leaving the level.
-Fixed a bug where paraghouls would teleport after restarting a chase

Player


Grapple now sticks to all objects (haven't figured out calculating rotated object positions though...)

Slide max fall speed increased (4 mps -> 9 mps)
Slide fall speed acceleration decreased(0.2 mps -> 0.1 mps)
Attack buffer window for ground combo increased (13 -> 17)

Air acceleration decreased to allow for more precise movement (0.2mps -> 0.17 mps)

Wallslide

Can now wallslide out of a jump
	-Previously could only wallslide while falling
	-If you don't want to wallslide, hold the jump button
Wallslide minimum jump height decreased (35% height -> 5% height)
Wallslide will now make you slide down a wall faster after repeatly sticking to the same wall multiple times.
	- These 2 changes are so that you can't go up a wall using grapple and just mashing jump.
Wallslide is now cancellable into attacks and dodge.
Can now wall bounce (remembers previous velocity and adds it to wall jump speed)

	

Jump

Jump squat frames increased (0 -> 3)
	-Jump squat is cancellable into attacks/dodge

Reduced grapple pull speed (0.2 mps horizontally, 0.5 mps vertically) -> (0.15 mps, 0.4 mps )


Slide

Cooldown reduced (0.7 -> 0.45)

Attack

Friction reduced on 3 hit combo
Attack buffer window for ground combo increased (13 -> 17)

	

Paraghoul
-Fireballs now actually do damage
-Fireballs now point in the direction they're going
-Fireballs now follow the player around
-Fireball max duration decreased (inf -> 3000 frames)
