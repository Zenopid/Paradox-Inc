Paradox v0.4.3 Patch Notes

I hate using Pixels Per Second so

100 pixels = 1 meter

MPS = Meters Per Second

Bug Fixes
-Fixed a bug where you could triple jump out of a slide.
-Fixed a bug where fireballs acted like walls and stopped your movement.

Player

Attack buffer window for 3 hit combo increased (13 -> 17)

Can now wallslide out of a jump
	-Previously could only wallslide while falling
	-If you don't want to wallslide, hold the jump button

Jump squat frames increased (0 frames -> 2 frames)

Reduced grapple pull speed (0.2 mps horizontally, 0.5 mps vertically) -> (0.15 mps, 0.4 mps )
Increased grapple projectile speed (105 mps -> 115 mps)

Paraghoul
-Fireballs now actually do damage
-Fireballs now point in the direction they're going
